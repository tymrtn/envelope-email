Your agent needs to manage email. You shouldn't need to configure DNS records, set up a new domain, or pay per-message fees to make that happen.

**Envelope: add your email address and password. That's it. Your agent reads, sends, replies, snoozes, tags, and filters email — from your existing mailbox.**

```bash
envelope accounts add --email you@gmail.com
envelope inbox --json
```

## Install

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS) — installs the binary named `envelope`
brew install tymrtn/u1f4e7/u1f4e7

# From source (Linux or macOS)
# 1. Install Rust if not already present:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh && source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# 2. Clone and build:
git clone https://github.com/tymrtn/U1F4E7
cd U1F4E7
cargo build --release
# binary: target/release/envelope

# 3. Install the binary somewhere on PATH:
cp target/release/envelope ~/.local/bin/envelope
```

## Quick start

> **Provider prerequisite:** Gmail, Fastmail, iCloud, and Outlook all require an *app password* — not your login password — before adding an account. Generate one in your provider's security settings first. If you skip this and get an auth error, run `envelope quickstart` and check the `remediation` field for provider-specific URLs.

```bash
# Add an account — Envelope auto-discovers IMAP/SMTP from the email domain.
# Interactive input is hidden. For non-interactive use, opt into stdin.
printf '%s\n' "$APP_PASSWORD" | envelope accounts add --email you@gmail.com --password-stdin

# Verify setup end-to-end (paths → account → IMAP auth → inbox peek)
envelope quickstart

# See folders with unread counts
envelope folders

# Read the inbox
envelope inbox --limit 20

# Read a message (does not mark it as read)
envelope read 42

# Send with attachment
envelope send --to someone@example.com --subject "Report" --body "Attached." --attach report.pdf

# Reply in-thread as a reviewable draft
envelope draft reply 42 --body "Thanks."

# Snooze until Monday
envelope snooze set 42 --until monday --reason waiting-reply

# Watch for new mail in real time (IMAP IDLE push)
envelope watch --json

# Retrieve a verification-code JSON result for unattended automation (bounded and fail-closed)
envelope --json code --account you@example.com --from otp@issuer.example --wait 60

# Schedule a send for business hours
envelope send --to cto@example.com --subject "Report" --body "..." --at "monday 9am"

# Import contacts from your inbox, then create a contact-based rule
envelope contacts import --from-inbox
envelope rule create --name "VIP" --match-contact-tag vip --action flag=\\Flagged

# Agent scores a message, creates a rule, Envelope enforces it forever
envelope tag set 42 --score urgent=0.1 --tag newsletter
envelope rule create --name "Junk newsletters" --match-tag newsletter --match-score-below interesting=0.3 --action move=Junk
envelope rule run --confirm

# Unsubscribe from a mailing list (dry-run by default)
envelope unsubscribe 99

# Open the local dashboard (loopback, no auth — single-user local trust)
envelope serve

# Expose it to agents/devices on your tailnet — REQUIRES auth first.
# Option A (humans): allowlist tailnet identities; `tailscale serve` proves them.
envelope config set dashboard.tailscale_allow "you@your-tailnet.ts.net,skippy@your-tailnet.ts.net"
# Option B (agents/scripts): a bearer token (stored 0600, never echoed).
envelope config set dashboard.auth_token "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

tailscale serve --bg 3141

# See where Envelope is storing local state
envelope paths
```

The dashboard opens as a three-pane mail shell. Unified Inbox is the default
read-only surface and loads from the local message index; explicit refreshes
or account/folder selections are what touch live IMAP mailboxes.

Actual sends are outbox-first. By default, an allowed send queues with a safety
cooldown and the scheduled-send sweep performs the SMTP transmission later.
Immediately before SMTP, Envelope derives sanitized contextual attributes and
asks Governor to score them with `governor score --catalog envelope`; only an
opaque Governor `allow` sends in required mode. Message bodies, full recipient
addresses, attachment bytes, and secrets never enter the Governor request.

Dashboard URL metadata in `--json` output is discovered fresh for each UI
construction or request, from an active local `tailscale serve` HTTPS route whose
root proxy targets `http://127.0.0.1:3141`. It otherwise falls back to
`http://localhost:3141`.
Every agent-facing `ui` object reports that decision as
`dashboard_origin_source` (`tailscale_serve` or `localhost_fallback`) and adds
a non-secret `dashboard_origin_warning` only when discovery needs attention.
`dashboard_path` is always portable and remains the canonical handle for agents;
`dashboard.base_url` and the legacy dashboard-base environment variables are
retained only for compatibility and do not affect emitted agent UI links.
Tailscale Serve keeps the dashboard tailnet-only; Tailscale Funnel publishes it
on the public internet, so do not use Funnel for a mailbox dashboard unless that
exposure is intentional.

### Authentication (required before any non-loopback exposure)

On `127.0.0.1` the dashboard is an unauthenticated single-user local surface —
the same trust boundary as your shell. The REST API reads and deletes mail,
manages accounts, and queues sends, so the moment it is reachable by another
device (a non-loopback `--bind`, or a `tailscale serve` front-end) it **must**
require a credential. Configure one of:

- **Tailscale identity allowlist** (`dashboard.tailscale_allow`) — a request
  whose `Tailscale-User-Login` header (injected by `tailscale serve`) is in the
  allowlist is authorized. Humans just open the `.ts.net` URL; no token to type.
  Only safe behind `tailscale serve`, which sets and strips that header.
- **Bearer token** (`dashboard.auth_token` or `ENVELOPE_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`) —
  sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `X-Envelope-Token`), compared in
  constant time. The path for Hermes/OpenClaw agents and scripts.

Once either is configured, every `/api` route returns `401` without a valid
credential — including when `tailscale serve` fronts loopback. `envelope serve
--bind <non-loopback>` **refuses to start** unless an auth method is configured.
`/api/health` stays reachable for liveness probes but discloses local
filesystem paths only to authorized callers. The CORS allowlist is a
browser-only defense, not the access control.

### vs. Cloudflare Email Service

Cloudflare's [Email Service](https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-for-agents/) (public beta, April 2026) is email infrastructure for the Cloudflare platform. Envelope is email mastery for your existing mailbox.

| | Envelope | Cloudflare Email |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| BYO mailbox (your existing email) | ✅ | ❌ Cloudflare routing |
| DNS setup required | **None** | Cloudflare DNS |
| Read inbox (full IMAP) | ✅ | ❌ Inbound routing only |
| Self-hosted | ✅ | ❌ Workers platform |
| Per-message cost | **$0** | Paid Workers plan |
| Agent-native | ✅ CLI + JSON | ✅ Workers SDK |

| Works offline | ✅ | ❌ Cloud-only |
| Any provider | ✅ Gmail, Outlook, Migadu, any IMAP | ❌ Cloudflare only |
| Open source | ✅ FSL-1.1-ALv2 | Reference app only |

### vs. Resend / Mailgun / SendGrid

| | Envelope | Resend | Mailgun | SendGrid |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| BYO mailbox | ✅ Your existing email | ❌ New domain | ❌ New domain | ❌ New domain |
| DNS setup | **None** | SPF/DKIM/DMARC | SPF/DKIM/DMARC | SPF/DKIM/DMARC |
| Per-message cost | **$0** | $0.001+ | $0.001+ | $0.001+ |
| Read inbox | ✅ Full IMAP | ❌ Send only | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited |
| Self-hosted | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Open source | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Provider support

Envelope auto-discovers IMAP/SMTP from your email domain via DNS. Tested with:

| Provider | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Gmail** | App password | `[Gmail]/` folder prefix handled automatically |
| **Outlook.com / Office 365** | App password | Exchange IMAP quirks handled |
| **Microsoft Workmail** | App password | Exchange-style folders |
| **Migadu** | Password | Standard folders |
| **Fastmail** | App password | Standard folders |
| **Self-hosted Dovecot** | Password | `INBOX.` dot-separator detected |
| **Generic IMAP** | Password | Anything RFC 3501 |

## MCP server

`envelope mcp` starts a Model Context Protocol server over stdio — drop-in email for Claude Code, Cursor, Zed, or any MCP runtime.

Framing follows the MCP stdio spec: one newline-delimited JSON-RPC message per line on stdout, nothing else on that stream (logs go to stderr). On stdin the server accepts newline-delimited JSON and, for callers written against versions before 1.1.0, the legacy `Content-Length:` framing — detected per message.

```bash
# Print a ready-to-paste config snippet
envelope mcp --config

# Output (paste into your MCP config):
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "envelope": {
#       "command": "/path/to/envelope",
#       "args": ["mcp"]
#     }
#   }
# }
```

22 tools: `inbox`, `read`, `search`, `send`, `reply`, `create_reply_draft`, `create_forward_draft`, `modify_draft`, `get_draft`, `send_draft`, `move_message`, `flag`, `folders`, `tag`, `contacts`, `accounts`, `bulk`, `thread`, `rules_preview`, `rules_run`, `watch_status`, `snooze`. Envelope is the only MCP email server that works against any IMAP provider.

For a single, distribution-ready operating guide to hand a fresh agent, see [the Envelope agent skill](docs/agents/envelope-skill.md).

For a walkthrough of running multiple agents from one shared inbox with scoped policies, see [Agents at a glance](docs/agent-fleet-shared-inbox.md).

## Rules engine

The agent is the intelligence. Envelope is the execution.

```bash
# 1. Agent reads inbox and scores each message
envelope inbox --json | jq -r '.[].uid' | while read uid; do
  envelope tag set "$uid" --score urgent=0.1 --score interesting=0.2 --tag newsletter
done

# 2. Agent creates rules from observed patterns
envelope rule create --name "Junk newsletters" \
  --match-tag newsletter --match-score-below interesting=0.3 \
  --action move=Junk

# 3. Preview, then explicitly confirm rule execution
# Preview is read-only; --confirm is required for mailbox mutation.
envelope rule preview
envelope rule run --confirm

# 4. Export to Sieve for server-side filtering
envelope rule export
```

The LLM teaches Envelope what to look for. Envelope applies those patterns deterministically. The LLM only re-engages when something new appears.

## Dashboard

`envelope serve` starts a localhost web UI at [http://localhost:3141](http://localhost:3141).

- Left mailbox sidebar with Unified Inbox, Today/Needs Attention, Snoozed,
  Sent, Drafts, All Mail, and account mailboxes
- Middle message list with a permanent right-side reader
- Agent Cockpit attention strip with expandable operator details
- Reply / Reply-all with automatic header threading
- Compose with text/html toggle and file attachments
- ★ Snoozed virtual folder with overdue highlighting
- IMAP search

## Travel

Envelope Travel is a self-hosted itinerary and family-coordination workspace at
[`/travel`](http://localhost:3141/travel). It uses the Gmail or Google Workspace
address you already own—no forwarding address or new travel account.

1. Turn on Google 2-Step Verification and create an app-specific password.
2. Run `envelope serve`, open **Travel**, and enter the address plus that app
   password. Envelope verifies Gmail before saving the encrypted credential.
   A fresh macOS install uses Keychain automatically; an existing encrypted
   file store remains in place. On a headless Linux host, set
   `ENVELOPE_MASTER_KEY` or `ENVELOPE_MASTER_PASSPHRASE_FILE` before starting
   the service.
3. Leave confirmations in the configured Gmail folder (INBOX by default), pick
   `[Gmail]/All Mail` in Travel settings to include archived confirmations, or
   paste a confirmation into the receipt desk. The mailbox scan is read-only:
   IMAP `EXAMINE` plus `BODY.PEEK[]` never marks mail as read.

The workspace groups flights, lodging, rail, cars, and activities into trips;
keeps the source receipt and parser provenance; quarantines uncertain details
for approval; detects emailed changes and cancellations; schedules reminders;
and provides shared tasks. Family links are revocable and structurally omit
confirmation codes, receipt text, private notes, and parser metadata. Each
share also gets a separate read-only `.ics` capability, so Apple Calendar,
Google Calendar, or another subscriber never receives task-edit authority.

For a computer-only install, keep `envelope serve` running while you need sync,
alerts, family pages, or calendar refreshes; a sleeping laptop cannot poll
Gmail. For access from family devices, the recommended remote shape is the
Tailscale setup in Quick start. For an always-on Linux host, install the
systemd user service from [docs/install-linux.md](docs/install-linux.md), put
`ENVELOPE_HOME` on persistent encrypted storage, require dashboard auth, and
terminate TLS with Tailscale Serve or a trusted reverse proxy. Do not expose a
mailbox dashboard anonymously. Gmail onboarding is deliberately disabled when
Envelope binds directly to a non-loopback address: enter the app password only
through localhost, or through an HTTPS/Tailscale proxy whose Envelope listener
remains on loopback. A custom proxy must overwrite `X-Forwarded-Proto` with the
actual client-facing scheme; plaintext proxy requests and conflicting HTTP
browser origins are refused for Gmail credential setup.

Travel changes and delays currently come from messages received in Gmail.
Live gate, aircraft, baggage-belt, and operational delay telemetry requires a
separate flight-status provider and is not inferred when the airline has not
emailed an update. Scheduled alerts appear in the Travel workspace; this build
does not yet deliver push notifications when the browser is closed.

## Commercial licensing

Personal use is free. Commercial rollout is a flat annual license sized by the number of mailbox users on one primary domain:

| Plan | Price | Scope | Support |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Personal | Free | Individual, non-commercial use on mailboxes you personally own and operate | Community support via GitHub issues |
| Team | $240/year | Commercial use for one organization, up to 10 mailbox users on one primary domain | Email support, best-effort next-business-day response |
| Growth | $960/year | Commercial use for one organization, up to 25 mailbox users on one primary domain | Priority email support, next-business-day response target |
| Enterprise | Contact us | 26+ users, multi-domain deployments, embedded/OEM, reseller terms, or custom security review | Custom support agreement |

"Commercial use" means any use of Envelope by or for a company, team, agency, or paid project, including internal operations, customer workflows, or embedding Envelope in a product. "Mailbox users" means distinct human or service mailbox identities on the licensed domain that Envelope is configured to read, send, or automate. One person with multiple aliases on the same mailbox counts as one user. "Domain" means one primary email domain; subdomains of that primary domain are included, and additional unrelated domains require Enterprise.

Licenses are annual, non-transferable across organizations, and renew on the anniversary of issue. Request an annual license at [ty@tmrtn.com](mailto:ty@tmrtn.com?subject=Envelope%20licensing).

## Evidence bundles

`envelope evidence` collects a query-scoped, local evidence bundle while leaving the source mailbox read-only. Collection opens the requested folder with IMAP `EXAMINE` and fetches canonical raw RFC822 originals with `BODY.PEEK[]`.

```bash
envelope evidence collect \
  --account user@example.com \
  --folder '[Gmail]/All Mail' \
  --query 'FROM "sender@example.com" SUBJECT "contract"' \
  --include-thread \
  --out ./evidence-bundle

envelope evidence verify --from ./evidence-bundle
envelope evidence verify --from ./evidence-bundle --strict
```

Structured filters can replace or combine with `--query`: `--from-address`, `--to-address`, `--subject`, `--since`, `--before`, `--body`, and repeatable `--keyword`. At least one filter is required unless the raw query is explicitly `ALL`.

Thread expansion is header-driven and bounded. By default, `--include-thread` fetches at most 500 messages while following Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References links; adjust with `--max-thread-messages`. If the cap is reached, the bundle records a warning.

Evidence bundles intentionally expose message metadata, account identity, IMAP host/username, and local source paths for provenance. Treat bundles as sensitive even though they do not serialize passwords, OAuth tokens, or credential file paths.

Bundle layout:

```text
evidence-bundle/
  manifest.json
  index.csv
  README.md
  SHA256SUMS
  bundle.sha256
  messages/<encoded-folder>/<uidvalidity>-<uid>.eml
```

Thread inclusion is driven only by `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, and `References`; subject matching is never used as a fallback. Hash files provide local tamper evidence, not an external signature. Non-goals for the MVP: ZIP packaging, detached signatures, PST/mbox conversion, multi-account collection, mailbox mutation, and restore/import into a mailbox.
