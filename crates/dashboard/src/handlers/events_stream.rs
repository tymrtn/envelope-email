//! `GET /api/events/stream` — Server-Sent Events fan-out of [`DashboardEvent`]s.
//!
//! This is a read-only push channel: it never mutates a mailbox and only relays
//! events other code already published to the broadcast bus. It lives inside the
//! protected router, so `require_auth` gates it and CSRF is skipped (GET).
//!
//! ## Authentication for `EventSource`
//! All authorization is done by the `require_auth` middleware ahead of this
//! handler; by the time `stream` runs the caller is already authorized (or, in
//! open-loopback mode, no credential is required). The browser `EventSource` API
//! cannot set an `Authorization` header, so two paths reach an authorized state:
//! - **Cookie / tailnet identity** (the normal browser path): the request rides
//!   the same cookie/`Tailscale-User-Login` credential every other `/api` call
//!   uses; `require_auth` accepts it.
//! - **`?access_token=<token>` query param** (bearer-only agent contexts, e.g.
//!   `curl`/scripts): `require_auth` accepts it via the same constant-time bearer
//!   comparison as the header token (see [`crate::auth::require_auth`]). A wrong
//!   token is rejected with `401` before this handler runs. Note the query token
//!   is deliberately NOT treated as CSRF-proof (a browser can carry a query
//!   string cross-site), so it never sets the `BearerAuthenticated` CSRF
//!   exemption — moot for this GET stream, but correct for the shared middleware.
//!
//!   Logging tradeoff: a token in the query string can appear in server-side
//!   request logs. Assessed: this dashboard's tracing does **not** log request
//!   URLs or query strings (no request-logging `TraceLayer`/access log is
//!   installed; the only URL-adjacent logs are explicit `info!`/`warn!` in sweeps
//!   that never include the raw URI). So the query token is not written to any
//!   log by the dashboard. If a request-logging layer is added later, it MUST
//!   redact the `access_token` query param.
