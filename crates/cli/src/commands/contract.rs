In required mode the Governor verdict fails closed: missing/error/deny/review all block the send; only an explicit allow permits SMTP.

At the sweep, origin is decided from durable provenance (a current persisted bot declaration, or the draft's created_by): a bot-originated draft ALWAYS requires a valid current declaration (approval by any non-dashboard surface adds tyler_approved on top; it never substitutes for the declaration). A genuinely human-originated (created_by human:*) draft that is also currently human-attested proceeds on its revision-bound human attestation without a bot declaration; unknown-provenance/unattested drafts fail closed as bot. SEPARATE from all of this, and limited to ONE transition: a send that a human queued through the dashboard's Human-only Send action is transmitted as a human send whatever authored the body — the gate is skipped and no Governor decision is recorded. That authorization is minted only by the dashboard send transition itself, bound to the exact draft revision, so a generic dashboard approval does NOT create one, an edit/attachment change/Hold withdraws it, and re-queueing through CLI `draft send` or MCP `send_draft` clears it. Agents cannot mint one and must not rely on one: every agent-queued send (CLI, MCP, scheduled) is governed and still owes its factual declaration, approved or not.",
