#[command(
    name = "envelope",
    version,
    about = "Email mastery for agents. BYO mailbox — give it an email and password, it does the rest.",
    after_help = r#"GETTING STARTED
  Add an account (auto-discovers IMAP/SMTP from the domain):
    envelope accounts add --email you@gmail.com

  Browse your inbox:
    envelope inbox
    envelope inbox --limit 10 --json

  Read a message (does not mark it as read):
    envelope read 42

  Send an email with an attachment:
    envelope send --to someone@example.com --subject "Report" --body "See attached" --attach report.pdf

  Search:
    envelope search "FROM boss@company.com"
    envelope search "SUBJECT invoice" --folder Sent

  Snooze a message until Monday:
    envelope snooze set 42 --until monday --reason follow-up

  Check for due snoozes and return them:
    envelope unsnooze --once

  Open the local dashboard (inbox, compose, reply, snooze, search):
    envelope serve

  List folders with unread counts:
    envelope folders

AGENT WORKFLOWS
  Watch for new mail in real time (IMAP IDLE push):
    envelope watch --json

  Extract a verification code (blocks until code arrives):
    CODE=$(envelope code --wait 60)

  Schedule a send for business hours:
    envelope send --to cto@example.com --subject "Report" --body "..." --at "monday 9am"

  Import contacts from your inbox, then create a rule:
    envelope contacts import --from-inbox
    envelope rule create --name "VIP" --match-contact-tag vip --action flag=\\Flagged

  Use Envelope as an MCP server (Claude Code, Cursor, Zed):
    envelope mcp --config

  Inspect the resolved local state paths:
    envelope paths
    envelope paths --json

  Share dashboard URLs for agent handoffs (after configuring dashboard auth):
    tailscale serve --bg 3141
    # Agent JSON discovers this live HTTPS Serve route; otherwise it uses localhost.

  Every command supports --json for machine consumption:
    envelope inbox --json | jq '.[0].subject'
    envelope folders --json | jq '.[] | {name: .folder, unseen}'

PROVIDERS
  Envelope auto-discovers IMAP/SMTP servers via DNS. Tested with:
    Gmail (app password), Outlook.com, Microsoft Workmail,
    Migadu, Fastmail, self-hosted Dovecot, generic IMAP.
