# Changelog

All notable changes to Envelope Email are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added

- **IMAP IDLE event stream** — `envelope watch` opens a persistent
  IMAP IDLE connection and emits JSON events on new mail in real time.
  Supports stdout, webhook (`--webhook <url>`), and SQLite event storage.
  Reconnects automatically on connection drop with exponential backoff.
  25-minute IDLE cycle stays under RFC 2177's 29-minute server timeout.

- **Verification code extraction** — `envelope code --wait 60` blocks
  until a verification/OTP code arrives, extracts it from the message
  body (regex patterns for explicit labels, OTP-style codes, HTML-prominent
  numbers, and standalone digits), and prints it to stdout. Pipe-friendly:
  `CODE=$(envelope code --wait 60)`. Filters by `--from` domain and
  `--subject` pattern.

- **MCP server** — `envelope mcp` starts a Model Context Protocol server
  over stdio, exposing 12 tools: inbox, read, search, send, reply,
  move_message, flag, folders, tag, contacts, accounts, and rule_run.
  `envelope mcp --config` prints a ready-to-paste JSON config snippet
  for Claude Code, Cursor, or Zed. Envelope is the only MCP email server
  that works against any IMAP provider (Gmail, Outlook, Migadu, Fastmail,
  self-hosted Dovecot).

- **Scheduled send** — `envelope send --to ... --at "monday 9am"` creates
  a draft with a scheduled send time. The `envelope serve` background
  ticker sends due messages automatically. `envelope scheduled list` and
  `envelope scheduled cancel <id>` manage the queue. Reuses the snooze
  datetime parser (ISO 8601, relative offsets, natural language).

- **Contacts** — `envelope contacts add/list/show/tag/untag/import`.
  Local contact store in SQLite with freeform tags (JSON array). Tags
  integrate with the rules engine: `--match-contact-tag vendor` creates
  a rule that matches any message from a contact tagged "vendor".
  `envelope contacts import --from-inbox` bootstraps the contacts table
  from inbox senders.

- **Webhook rule actions** — `envelope rule create --action webhook=<url>`
  POSTs message context as JSON to the webhook URL when a rule matches.
  10-second timeout, fire-and-forget. Enables integrating Envelope's
  rules engine with external systems (n8n, Make, custom scripts).

- **SQLite schema migrations** — Replaced hand-rolled `CREATE TABLE IF
  NOT EXISTS` with `rusqlite_migration` (v1.3). Tracks schema version
  via `PRAGMA user_version`. Existing databases upgrade seamlessly.
  All v0.5.0 tables (events, contacts) are added as versioned migrations.

- **Agent Workflows help section** — `envelope --help` now shows a
  dedicated "Agent Workflows" section with copy-paste one-liners for
  watch, code extraction, scheduled send, contacts import, and MCP setup.

### Changed

- Workspace version bumped to 0.5.0.
- `regex` added as a dependency (for verification code extraction).
- `rusqlite_migration` added as a dependency (schema versioning).
- `ContactHasTag` added to the rules engine `MatchExpr` enum. Rules
  can now match on the sender's contact tags, not just message-level tags.

[0.5.0]: https://github.com/tymrtn/U1F4E7/releases/tag/v0.5.0

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- Exposed `snooze check-replies` subcommand — was implemented but not
  wired into the clap dispatch.
- Dashboard compose handler updated for `from_override` parameter added
  to `SmtpSender::send`.

### Changed

- Repo renamed from `tymrtn/envelope-email` to `tymrtn/U1F4E7`. Old URL
  redirects. Brew tap moved to `tymrtn/homebrew-u1f4e7`
  (`brew install tymrtn/u1f4e7/u1f4e7`). Python prototype archived at
  `tymrtn/U1F4E7-python`.

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/tymrtn/U1F4E7/releases/tag/v0.4.1

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Rules engine** — agents create mail rules that Envelope enforces
  deterministically. `envelope rule create --name "..." --match-from "..."
  --action move=Junk`. Rules evaluate match expressions (FROM/TO/SUBJECT
  globs, tag checks, score thresholds) against messages and execute actions
  (move, flag, unflag, snooze, delete, unsubscribe, add tag). All-match
  default with optional `stop` flag per rule. Batch execution in groups of
  50 with progress reporting.
- **Message tagging + scoring** — `envelope tag set <uid> --score urgent=0.9
  --tag newsletter`. Scores are float dimensions (0.0–1.0), tags are
  freeform strings. Keyed on Message-ID (stable across folder moves).
  Rules can match on tags and scores for agent-trained junk filtering.
- **List-Unsubscribe** — `envelope unsubscribe <uid> --confirm`. Parses
  RFC 2369 `List-Unsubscribe` and RFC 8058 one-click POST headers.
  Dry-run by default (shows what it would do), `--confirm` to execute.
  Never auto-follows GET URLs (tracking risk). Supports HTTPS POST
  and mailto fallback.
- **Sieve export** — `envelope rule export`. Generates RFC 5228 Sieve
  scripts from rules that use pure IMAP-level matches (FROM/TO/SUBJECT).
  Tag/score-based rules are local-only and skipped with a warning.
  ManageSieve upload deferred to v0.5.
- **Background unsnooze ticker** — `envelope serve` now spawns a tokio
  task that sweeps the snooze queue every 60 seconds and returns due
  messages to their original folders automatically.
- **IMAP connection retry** — dashboard folder handler retries with a
  fresh connection on stale IMAP pooled connections.
- **Loading indicators** — dashboard shows "Loading folders…" / "Loading
  messages…" / "Loading message…" while IMAP fetches are in flight.
- **Account list collapse** — sidebar shows 3 accounts by default with
  a "+ N more" toggle for large account lists.
- **Account label in inbox title** — shows "INBOX — tyler@example.com"
  so you always know which account's inbox you're looking at.
- **Rich `--help`** — getting-started examples, agent usage patterns,
  and provider list in the top-level help output.

### Changed

- Workspace version bumped to 0.4.0.
- `reqwest` added as a dependency (for HTTPS unsubscribe).

### Fixed

- **RFC 2047 subject decoding** — IMAP ENVELOPE subjects now decode
  `=?utf-8?q?...?=` and `=?utf-8?b?...?=` encoded words instead of
  showing raw encoded strings. Handles Q-encoding, B-encoding, UTF-8,
  and multiple consecutive encoded words with whitespace folding.
- Sequential folder/message loading — folders load before messages
  (was racing, causing "no account selected" in sidebar).
- Folder error recovery with retry button on IMAP failures.

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/tymrtn/U1F4E7/releases/tag/v0.4.0

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Full dashboard rewrite.** `envelope serve` now launches a complete
  three-pane email client (folder sidebar, inbox list, reader + composer
  drawers) at [http://localhost:3141](http://localhost:3141). Ported the
  Instrument Sans / DM Mono light-theme aesthetic from the Python U1F4E7
  prototype. HTML/CSS/JS bundled into the binary via `rust-embed` — a
  single `cargo install` ships the whole UI.
- **REST API backing the dashboard** (`/api/*`) with routes for accounts,
  folders (with unread counts), messages (list/read/flag/move/delete/search),
  attachments, compose, reply, drafts, snoozed, threads, and stats.
- **Reply / reply-all** with correct header threading. New
  `envelope_email_transport::reply` module builds `In-Reply-To` and
  `References` headers from the parent message, handles 11 international
  `Re:`/`Fwd:` prefixes, and excludes the account owner from reply-all
  Cc. Works from both the CLI (via `envelope send`) and the dashboard
  reader.
- **SMTP attachments.** `envelope send --to x --attach file.pdf --attach other.png`
  wraps the message body in `multipart/mixed` with one part per file.
  Content-Type detection via `mime_guess`. The dashboard composer
  base64-encodes files client-side and posts them in the JSON envelope.
- **Snooze feature** (`envelope snooze set|list|cancel`, `envelope unsnooze`).
  Flexible datetime parsing: ISO 8601, relative (`2h`, `3d`, `1w`),
  natural (`tomorrow`, `monday`, `next week`). Escalation tiers,
  waiting-reply tracking, per-account IMAP `Snoozed` folder.
- **Threading** (`envelope thread show|list|build`). RFC 2822
  header walking (`Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, `References`) with a
  normalized-subject fallback for messages missing threading headers.
  11-language subject prefix stripping (English, German, French, Spanish,
  Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish/Norwegian).
- **`envelope folders`** now shows per-folder `exists / unseen`
  counts via the IMAP `STATUS` command, both in human output and `--json`.
- **`envelope read <uid>`** uses `BODY.PEEK[]` so reading a message does
  NOT auto-set the `\Seen` flag on the server. Explicit `envelope flag add
  <uid> seen` is required to mark as read.
- **`envelope mark_seen`** helper (library API) for callers that want
  explicit read-marking after `fetch_message`.
- **Orphan detection CI guard** (`ci/check-orphans.sh`). Fails when any
  `.rs` file in `crates/*/src/` is not declared via `mod` — prevents
  the class of silent regression that lost the snooze and threading
  features in commit `27f3919` (see `docs/ORPHANS-AUDIT.md`).
- **`docs/ORPHANS-AUDIT.md`** — post-mortem of the 27f3919 regression
  and the measures taken to prevent recurrence.

### Changed

- **Binary renamed from `envelope-email` to `envelope`.** The Cargo
  package name remains `envelope-email` to preserve the crates.io slot,
  but the binary target is now `envelope`. `cargo install envelope-email`
  installs a binary called `envelope`. Users who installed 0.1.x via
  `cargo install` or Homebrew need to either re-run the install or
  update their PATH.
- `envelope folders` text output gained the `exists / unseen` columns.
- `envelope serve` default port remains 3141. The old 4-endpoint stub
  is gone; the full dashboard is the only option now.
- `crates/dashboard` no longer embeds HTML as a Rust string — it lives
  in `static/` and is bundled at compile time via `rust-embed`.

### Fixed

- **Restored the orphaned snooze feature** (`crates/store/src/snoozed.rs`
  and `crates/cli/src/commands/snooze.rs`, ~1,276 lines). These files
  shipped in commit `27f3919` but were never declared via `mod` and
  never compiled — the feature silently didn't exist. Recreated the
  missing `SnoozedMessage` model, `snoozed` table DDL, and wired the
  impl + CLI into the module tree. Added a `snoozed.reply_received`
  column and `escalation_tier` column that the orphan code expected.
- **Restored the orphaned threading feature** (`crates/email/src/threading.rs`,
  `crates/store/src/threads.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/thread.rs`,
  ~2,211 lines). Same silent regression from commit `27f3919`. Recreated
  `Thread` + `ThreadMessage` models, `threads` + `thread_messages` +
  `thread_sync_state` table DDL, and wired everything into `mod`. Fixed
  drift where `thread_messages.id` was defined as `TEXT` but the code
  expected `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`. Fixed `Option<String>`
  handling in display code paths.
- `threading::normalize_subject` now delegates to a new
  `strip_reply_prefixes` helper that preserves case; `normalize_subject`
  lowercases the result for thread grouping only. Previously the
  lowercasing leaked into any caller using it for display.
- `envelope read` correctly uses `BODY.PEEK[]` (guarded by a unit test).

### Removed

- **All governor / policy / scoring integration** (`crates/cli/src/governor.rs`,
  `crates/cli/src/commands/governor.rs`, the `Governor` clap subcommand,
  and — most importantly — the `--no-governor` CLI flag that was a
  self-documenting backdoor on a public tool). If you want governance
  around destructive or outbound operations, wrap Envelope from outside:
  `governor envelope send ... -- --attr user_requested`. Envelope's
  job is email.

### Notes

- This is the first release with a proper CHANGELOG. Prior releases
  (0.1.0, 0.2.x) shipped without one; their commit history is the only
  record.
- Total work landed in 0.3.0: ~5,000 lines added, 8 commits, 113 tests
  passing (40 store + 63 email + 10 dashboard), zero clippy warnings in
  new code, `ci/check-orphans.sh` clean.
